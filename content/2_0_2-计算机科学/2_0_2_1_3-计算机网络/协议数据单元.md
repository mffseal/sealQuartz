# 协议数据单元

Actually, there are five words commonly used when we talk about layers of reference models (or protocol stacks): `data`, `segment`, `packet`, `frame` and `bit`. And the term PDU (`Protocol Data Unit`) is a generic term used to refer to the packets in different layers of the OSI model. Thus PDU gives an abstract idea of the data packets. The PDU has a different meaning in different layers still we can use it as a common term.

When we come to your question, we can call all of them by using the general term `PDU`, but if you want to call them specifically at a given layer:

-   **Data:** PDU of Application, Presentation and Session Layers
-   **Segment:** PDU of Transport Layer
-   **Packet:** PDU of network Layer
-   **Frame:** PDU of data-link Layer
-   **Bit:** PDU of physical Layer
